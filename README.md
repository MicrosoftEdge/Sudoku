Sudoku
======

In this demo we take the well-known game of Sudoku, and demonstrate how developers can use HTML5 and JavaScript to create an efficient algorithm to solve these puzzles. The algorithms draw heavily on the Chakra engine’s support for ECMAScript 5 standard array operations to rapidly solve many Sudoku games. You can also manually solve Sudoku puzzles.
